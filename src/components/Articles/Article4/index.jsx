During my time at my most recent contract I was tasked with building the new **[TwinStream website](https://twinstream.com)** with **React**, I decided to use the opportunity to try **Tailwind CSS**, and it proved to be an excellent choice for several reasons.

The website was built using **React**, and deployed and hosted in **AWS**.

---

## **Speed & Efficiency**  
Tailwindâ€™s **utility-first approach** allowed for rapid styling **without writing custom CSS**. Instead of switching between CSS files and components, styling was done **inline within JSX**, significantly **speeding up development**.  

This kept styles **scoped, maintainable, and easy to read**.  

---

## **Consistent & Scalable Design**  
- Tailwindâ€™s **design tokens** (colors, spacing, typography) ensured a **consistent** UI across the site.  
- **Theme customization** allowed us to extend default styles while keeping branding intact.  
- Using **variants & responsive utilities**, we made components **fully responsive without media queries**.  

---

## **Performance Benefits**  
Tailwindâ€™s **purge feature** removed unused CSS in production, keeping the final CSS **lightweight and optimized**.  

**Smaller CSS bundle size** = **Faster page loads**  

---

## **Developer Experience**  
- **Fewer context switches** â€“ No need to jump between CSS files.  
- **Reusable components** â€“ Styled quickly without creating a bloated stylesheet.  
- **Dark mode & animations** â€“ Handled effortlessly with built-in utilities.  

---

## **Final Thoughts**  
Tailwind CSS **significantly enhanced productivity** while ensuring **aesthetically pleasing, responsive, and maintainable** styles for twinstream.com. Itâ€™s a **perfect fit** for modern React projects where speed, consistency, and scalability matter. ðŸ’¡âœ¨  

Would I use it again? **Absolutely!**
